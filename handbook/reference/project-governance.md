## Main governance bodies

In the context of our projects, governance encompasses the policies, the procedures and the documents that define their decision-making procedures.

Projects almost always have a main technical and a business governance body.

All of our projects document a technical community governance structure ("Technical Charter"). Anyone can contribute to our projects as long as they follow the Technical Charter.

With very few exceptions, our projects maintain **separate governing bodies** for running the technical project, and for collecting and spending money.

We do this deliberately, so that we have a **thorough separation** between contributing dues as a member, and achieving technical influence.

We achieve this by having **separate governance policies and procedures for each**, and in some cases, they actually exist in different entities.

### Business governance

- Called "Governing Board" or "Board of Directors".
- Companies become members by paying dues.
- Makes decisions on how to spend the money that they collect.
- Decides strategic policy.
- Governed by "Bylaws" or a "Charter".

### Technical governance

- Called "TSC", "TAC", "TOC", etc.
- Individuals become members by making technical contributions.
- Sometimes leadership roles are only for members, but not always.
- Membership can always be earned by non-members.
- Does not collect or spend money.
- Decides technical policy.
- Governed by "Technical Charter".

Note: TSC is generally used as the committee overseeing a specific project. A TAC/TOC/TOB/CPCC (Technical Advisory, Oversight, Cross Project) is a committee that helps multiple technical projects (each with a TSC) under an umbrella structure coordinate.
