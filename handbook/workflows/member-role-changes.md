## Workflow

1. Project members should use the [Member Support Desk](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NHPRGfcyg8FVNlRC9-HX-hOIYbafXxtu5Bie3wNCvSg/edit?usp=sharing) to report changes in project roles.  If there are exceptions, and you feel like you need to do this yourself, please add the use case to this section of the handbook. To process a role change on behalf of a member organization (not recommended), open a Jira ticket in the [Staff portal](https://staff.linuxfoundation.org/) and go to Membership and Sales Ops.
2. LF Operations will update the CRM (Customer Relationship Management, currently Salesforce, moving to Hubspot.) 
3. After LF Operations updates the CRM, they will notify the Project Administrator on the Jira tracker. The Project Administrator updates the Project Control Center ([PCC](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/project-control-center-pre-release)) and the [Organization Dashboard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i_0rHkjOzpqUOW5kTA4y_Y5taFR8-oRjwvmU3ME3VJ0/edit?usp=sharing). 
4. Make sure that everywhere else, outside of the PCC and Organization Dashboard, is also updated. Examples include calendar invitations, and email lists not managed within the PCC. 
5. Best practice is to refresh all the roles for the organization in that project to keep all contacts up to date.
